#Palvelinten hallinta, h3

This is a homework report for my university course about Salt. 
I'm learning how to use git via ubuntu server, so bear with me. 
Creating thir report in markdown means I have succeeded in the first objective, b).

I used the Ubuntu Server terminal to push my salt directory, as seen on GitHub.

c) I am unsure what the assignment is asking for.
I am to 'show' examples of the commands "git log", "git diff" and "git blame".
However, I haven't the faintest idea how to pull the information in a format easy 
to either copy and paste, or to display as an image on this report. What I can do,
is to describe my observations after executing these commands.


"git log" gives me "commit <massive alphanumeric string> (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEaD)
and the author's name and email, and the date the push was made. It also tells me what I wrote as the push comment.
There is a second alphanumeric string that looks like the same length, with the same information.
There is no comment, but there are the words "Initial commit". I can extrapolate that every commit will be logged in a similar way and the alphanumeric string will be its unique identifier.

"git diff" currently does nothing visible.

"git blame" appears to be a tool which can be used to extract data from the repository and its workings. My skill level is too low to understand how to use it.

d) I created a directory called "penis" and used the git reset --hard command to reset it to its last committed state, I presume.

e) I am submitting my previously created Chromium module for this part.
